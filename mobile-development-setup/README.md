# Mobile Development Environment Setup

## Objective
The goal of this setup is to prepare a working environment for mobile app development using **Expo Framework** and **React Native**. This setup enables efficient testing and deployment of mobile applications directly from a physical device using **Expo Go**.

---

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following tools are installed and working properly:

- **Node.js LTS** (Long Term Support)
- **VS Code** (Visual Studio Code IDE)
- **Operating System:** macOS, Linux, or Windows
- **Expo Go** app installed on your mobile device (Android/iOS)

---

## Why Use Expo Go?
Mobile development typically requires emulators or simulators for testing, which can be resource-intensive and may vary across devices.  
**Expo Go** solves this problem by allowing developers to run and test apps directly on their physical phones — making the process lightweight, fast, and platform-independent.

## Steps to Install Expo Go

1. **Visit the Expo Go homepage**  
   🔗 [https://expo.dev/go](https://expo.dev/go)

2. **Select the latest SDK version.**

3. **Install for your device:**
   - **Android:** [Download from Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)
   - **iOS:** [Download from Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779)

4. **Open the Expo Go app** on your phone.

5. **Create an Expo account** (or log in if you already have one).

6. **Connect your device and PC to the same Wi-Fi network.**  
   This allows you to scan QR codes generated by your Expo projects and view changes instantly on your device.
